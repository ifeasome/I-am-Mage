## Description
An online image repository that allows users to sign in using Single Sign-On (sso) to upload images that tells an ongoing story based on uploaded images by other users. Think of pictionary....but different. Also, do try the dark mode toggler to the left of the page. It truly is my favourite thing!


## Installation 

No installation required to run application. 

However, 

To clone program's repo, run the following command line in your terminal/git bash: 
>A side note for cloning this repo. This app uses config variables from firebase. To be able to effectively run app, you would need to do a firebase set up for authentication, storage and firestore. 

`git clone git@github.com:ifeasome/i-am-mage.git`. 

To view repo, go to: [Application Repo](https://github.com/ifeasome/i-am-mage).


## Usage 
This app for those with an avid imagination. Join in the collective picture-telling. You put up a pciture that says something without words and continue the story of others before you. It is a relay pictionary game. You add a picture and see how yours fits in with the evergoing story. See [Tests](#Tests) for a demo on how the app runs.
